# Index Positions
# cars = ["ferrari", "porsche", "chevy", "honda"]
# index positions are the placing that the above example of cars is in
# the index position for the ferrai is [0]
# you always begin with [0] and work up. In this case we have [4] index positions

#  New array method:
# method: .delete
# example: cars = ["ferrari", "porsche", "chevy", "honda"]
#          cars.delete ("honda")
#          cars = ["ferrari", "porsche", "chevy"]
# Using the delete method will delete any element from the array like we
# did with "honda" in the above example.
